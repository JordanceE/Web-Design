            <p>
                I come from a small city in Macedonia called Sveti Nikole.
                We are a family of five and I have two older sisters.
                We were a pretty normal family and lived a normal life.
                My sisters were one of the best students in their schools and studied a lot
                they thrived for success. Seeing that from a young age I always wanted to be the best
                in everything and the smartest but still i was a bit lazy and wanted to have fun.
                However, I did know to speak better english than my sisters from a very young age.
                you could say I'm kind of bilingual because I don't remember being unable to speak english
                I even had problems as a child with pronouncing the macedonian R because I had adopted
                the english R in my pronouncing of the letter at least that is what the speech therapist I went to
                theorized.

                My teens to say the least were pretty interesting.
                I got to know a lot of wonderful and great people.
                However, as all teen years I also met people that I thought would be in my life forever
                and of course I was wrong and the consequences of that were that I struggled and
                had difficult times with my emotions especially when it came to people I loved.
                I enjoyed my teens and I grew a lot as a person in them, I wouldn't change almost anything
                from the past because I wouldn't be the person I am now.
                At that time I thought that it was unfair that unlike my friends my dad had a farm and
                I had to work in the fields from sunrise to sunset since the beginning of my teens.
                This lead to me missing out on a lot of parties and stuff I really wanted to attend and have
                less time for fun but still I understand now that it doesn't really matter or change much
                and working from a young age and learning about hard work is something I value most now.
                The summary of my teen years is that I traveled a bit a partied and worked a ton.
                I also was pretty pro-active in the community as a teen i wanted to contribute
                and be part of bigger things and gain leadership and teamwork as skills which I did
                and I'm proud of that.

                And here I am now. I'm at university learning Software Engineering
                with big plans of focusing my time and money to invest in myself and
                looking to gather knowledge and money and use my time as best as I can.
                I have a big dream of me changing the world and be impactful.
                My time is occupied with a lot of different things together with studying
                like learning german still working and helping my father with the farm,
                working as a waiter in a restaurant and I'm going to go in Germany
                through work and travel as a student to earn more money there.
                I barely party anymore because I understand that if I want to
                reach my goals I have to invest all of my time and sweat
                toward them and this is still risky but it's a risk I'm willing to take.
