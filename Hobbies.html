    <h2>Basketball</h2>

            One of the hobbies I've had since I was 6-7 years old
            was playing basketball. I started training basketball at that
            age and always enjoyed playing it especially with my friends.
            I was never a team player really. I would win alone against 3 of my friends
            that were the same age as me and played as much as I did. I miss basketball I haven't played it
            in the last year as much.

    <h2>Dota 2</h2>
    <div class="hobi">
        <p>
            This hobby I started just as I got in my teens.
            A couple of my friends at that time all started playing so I didn't want to be left out
            so I started too. I was one of the best at the game in my town but I didn't want to
            spend my life playing games and that's when i stopped and started partying more.
            I still play a bit even till this day just for fun and to relax from a hard day of working or studying.
